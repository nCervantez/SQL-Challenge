# SQL-Challenge

### Purpose
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The purpose of this Challenge is to create tables in a new database, import data from csv's into the new tables, and perform data analysis using SQL queries in PostgreSQL.

### Data Analysis Tasks
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
  - List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986. 
  - List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name. 
  - List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name. 
  - List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B. 
  - List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name. 
  - List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name. 
  - List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).

### Conclusion
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have created two SQL files for this challenge. The first file (table_create_schema.sql) is the schema to create the tables for this database.
The second file (queries.sql) provides a list of queries to perform the data analysis listed above. This challenge serves as a starting point for performing data analysis in databases using SQL queries in PostgreSQL.
